# Ommyochain <sup>BETA</sup> is temporarily unavailable

<br>
<br>
<br>

Ommyochain is temporarily down or undergoing a planned maintenance. We apologize for the inconvenience — our team is on it,
we'll be back up in a bit!

While keeping 100% Ommyochain uptime can be challenging at this stage, **the security of users' assets is not affected at
all by any operational issues**. A great thing about ZK rollup — the tech that powers Ommyochain — is that the funds are
[secured purely by smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs](/userdocs/security). The Ommyochain
[protocol](https://github.com/Ommyochain/Ommyochain-docs/blob/master/docs/protocol.md) guarantees that any assets deposited into
it will always be retrievable on Ethereum, even if all Ommyochain operators were shut down permanently or became malicious.
Both smart contract and zero-knowledge parts of Ommyochain have been [thoroughly audited](/updates/security-audits).

You can monitor the operational status of all Ommyochain components and testnets at the
[Ommyochain status page](https://uptime.com/s/Ommyochain). Feel free to [contact us](/contact) if you have
any further questions.

Sincerely,

Your Matter Labs Team
